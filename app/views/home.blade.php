    <h4 class="justify">Meet Pley, created by parents, recommended by experts and loved by kids across the nation</h4>

    <p class="justify">Hi, we are Ranan Lachman and Elina Furman, the founders of Pley. We wanted our kids to spend less
        time in front of digital screens and more time enriching their minds and creativity with LEGO&reg;
        play. After spending thousands of dollars on new sets, we realized there is a better way to
        build LEGO creations without breaking our bank accounts &ndash; so we invented Pley.</p>

    <p class="justify">Leveraging the sharing economy, Pley makes it possible for families to save hundreds of dollars
        on toys that are usually short-lived and allows parents to bond with their kids while having the
        toys conveniently delivered to their door. Pleyâ€™s eco-friendly service also reduces pollution as
        each rented set saves a tree over its rental lifetime ;-)</p>
